# car
This gives the python implementation of car dataset analysis with correlation and regression
The project analyses and finds the categorical variables that influence the outcome of the dataset.
It is visualized using many graphs based on the credit score,occupation,monthly income,etc.
The outliers are predicted using inter quartile range(IQR) method and the result is found to be accurate enough to analyse the data.
The machine learning models used are:
1)Logistic regression
2)Decision tree
3)Random Forest
4)Extra Tree
5)Kneighbours classifier
6)Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier
The project then from the results obtained predicts whether a person owns a car or not.
